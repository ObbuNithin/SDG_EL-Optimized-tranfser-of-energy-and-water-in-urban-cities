# CityResource AI

CityResource AI is an intelligent, multi-objective framework for the resilient optimization of urban energy and water resources. It leverages a hybrid of AI and mathematical programming to create a robust decision support system for smart cities.

## üìú Description

Modern cities face increasing stress on their critical energy and water systems due to rapid urban growth, climate change, and unexpected disruptions. Most existing resource management solutions operate in isolation and are reactive rather than predictive, lacking real-time adaptability.

**CityResource AI** addresses this challenge by providing an integrated, AI-driven platform that intelligently allocates both energy and water. The system uses a combination of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **Machine Learning (ML)** forecasting, and **Linear/Nonlinear Programming (LP/NLP)** to adapt to real-time conditions, predict future demand, and optimize resource distribution for sustainability and resilience. It also includes a full-stack simulation platform to model and visualize resource dynamics in a smart city environment.

## ‚ú® Core Features

The framework is built around five key optimization modules and a full-stack simulation interface:

* **‚ö° RL-Based Energy Scheduling** ‚Äì A Reinforcement Learning agent dynamically schedules energy storage (charging/discharging) and load shedding to minimize unmet demand, learning adaptive strategies for handling energy shortfalls.
* **Forecasting-Driven Energy Allocation** ‚Äì Employs **XGBoost** and **LightGBM** models to forecast energy demand and solar generation, feeding these predictions into a Linear Programming model to minimize costs and preemptively allocate resources.
* **Disruption-Aware Energy Optimization** ‚Äì Uses **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** models to predict the likelihood and severity of grid outages or solar dips, allowing the system to adjust energy allocation in real-time to enhance resilience.
* **üíß Hybrid Water Allocation Engine** ‚Äì Utilizes both Linear and Nonlinear Programming to perform optimal water allocation across municipal, agricultural, and industrial sectors while respecting source constraints and sectoral priorities.
* **Sustainable Groundwater Management** ‚Äì Determines the ideal daily groundwater extraction volume, balancing the immediate need for supply with the long-term sustainability of the aquifer, even factoring in the energy cost of pumping.
* **üèôÔ∏è Full-Stack City Simulation** ‚Äì A complete simulation platform with a **Python (Flask)** backend and a **React.js** frontend. It simulates city demographics, automatically calculates water demand, and displays results on interactive dashboards.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

CityResource AI is designed as a modular, full-stack platform that integrates advanced optimization with real-time simulation and visualization.

1. **Data Layer** ‚Äì Consumes real-world time-series data for energy and water, sourced from platforms like NITI Aayog and the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB).
2. **Backend Engine** ‚Äì Implemented in **Python** using **Flask**, the backend handles all data processing, manages the **SQLite** database, and runs the core optimization and machine learning models.
3. **Frontend Interface** ‚Äì Developed using **React.js**, the user interface provides interactive dashboards to visualize building-wise and city-wide water demand, allocation trends, and optimization results.

## üìñ Usage & Simulation Flow

The system is designed as a decision support and simulation tool. The typical workflow is automated:

1. **Initialization** ‚Äì A city layout is initialized in the database, with a randomized number of buildings, houses, and residents to ensure variability.
2. **Demand Calculation** ‚Äì Water and energy demand are calculated automatically based on the simulated population and historical patterns. For example, daily water requirements are calculated at 175 liters per person.
3. **Optimization Run** ‚Äì The backend runs the suite of energy and water optimization modules, which make decisions on resource allocation, storage, and extraction based on the current state and forecasts.
4. **Visualization** ‚Äì The results are sent to the React frontend via REST APIs. Users can then explore the interactive dashboards to see city-wide demand, per-building allocations, unmet demand analysis, and other key performance metrics.
